ENTRY VII :
<br>
<br>the light breaks as the man enter the room.
<br>white coats the insides of the room, resembling blood in its appearence.
<br>hell and heaven break loose in the man's chaotic mind, and his eyes never seem to focus on what's in front of him; he's looking blankly at the exit door, contemplating, lost in a maze of his own design.
<br>he doesn't seem to feel the time flow, he doesn't seem to feel his blood flow.
<br>hours pass, and his muscles cannot continue to hold the unholy weight of his thoughts, and so every fiber, every tissue in his body starts to tear down.
<br>yet, the man doesn't mind his own collapsing, and continues to gaze into the abyss.
<br>the abyss.
<br>
<br>he is in fact. the abyss.
<br>his eyes curse him actively, as the tears start to tear his own face.
<br>the tears roll down his face, trying to escape the reality of their existence.
<br>to remember, he is trying.
<br>to forget, he is avoiding.
<br>
<br>he thinks... and the thought will linger on.
<br>
<br>damned is man.
<br>damned is man to think.
<br>
<br>and then... the light pierces his heart.
<br>for a moment, he felt Life blooming in his chest, as Death watches the chaos unleashing in his eyes...
<br>and then the man died <a href="home.html">in grief</a>.
